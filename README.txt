JHOVE2 -- Next-generation architecture for format-aware characterization

JHOVE2 is a collaborative project of the California Digital Library, Portico, and Stanford University.  The goals of the project are: 

    * To refactor the existing JHOVE architecture and API in order to:
          o Rectify known inefficiencies and idiosyncrasies of design and implementation
          o Simplify the process of integrating JHOVE2 technologyinto other systems, services, and workflows
          o Encourage third-party extensions to the baseline JHOVE2 functionality

    * To support enhancements to existing JHOVE functionality, including:
          o Separation of identity detection from validation
          o A more sophisticated digital object model explicitly supporting complex multi-file or hierarchical objects
          o A more generic plug-in architecture
          o Standardized error and profile handling
          o A rules-based assessment of characterization information in the context of local policies

    * To develop JHOVE2 modules supporting a number of important preservation-related processes
      Digital preservation is the set of intentions, strategies, and activities aimed at ensuring the continuing 
      usability of digital objects over time. However, since digital objects rely on explicit technological mediation 
      in order to be useful, they are inherently fragile with respect to technological change. Over any significant time period, a gap inevitably arises in the ability of a digital object to function in contemporaneous technological contexts. Put most simply, digital preservation is concerned with effectively managing the consequences of this gap, which is achievable only to the extent to which the gap is quantifiable. The necessary quantification comes, in part, from characterization.
      Characterization exposes the significant properties of a digital object and provides a stable starting point 
      for iterative preservation planning and action. The JHOVE2 project defines characterization in terms of four aspects:

    * Identification. Identification is the process of determining the presumptive format of a digital object 
      on the basis of suggestive extrinsic hints (for example, an HTTP Content-type header) and intrinsic 
      signatures, both internal (a magic number) and external (a file extension). Ideally, format identification 
      should be reported in terms of a level of confidence.

    * Validation. Validation is the process of determining a digital object's level of conformance to the 
      requirements of its presumptive format. These requirements are expressed by the normative syntactic and 
      semantic rules of that format's authoritative specification. Ideally, the determination of conformance 
      should be based on commonly accepted objective criteria. However, many format specifications - particularly 
      those not created as part of explicit standardization efforts - suffer from ambiguous language requiring subjective 
      interpretation. The incorporation of such interpretative decisions into automated systems should be highly 
      configurable to support local variation of preservation policy and practice.

    * Feature extraction. Feature extraction is the process of reporting the intrinsic properties of a digital 
      object significant to preservation planning and action. These features can function in many contexts as a 
      surrogate for the object itself for purposes of evaluation and decision making. Note that since digital 
      preservation is concerned with planning for future activities, potentially in response to unforeseeable circumstances, predicting which properties will one day be significant can be problematic. Prudence therefore suggests reporting the most inclusive set of properties possible, while providing sufficiently fine granularity of control to allow for appropriate localized configuration.

    * Assessment. Assessment is the process of determining the level of acceptability of a digital object for a 
      specific use on the basis of locally-defined policies. Assessments can be used to select appropriate 
      processing actions. In a repository ingest workflow, for example, the range of possible actions could 
      include rejection, normalization, or acceptance in original form.

Reduced to simpler terms, characterization answers the following questions relevant to the preservation of a digital object:

    * What is it?
    * What is it really?
    * What are its salient characteristics?
    * What should be done with it?

Or, more reductively, What? and So What?
