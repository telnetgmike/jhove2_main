/**
 * JHOVE2 annotation marking reportable properties. A reportable property is a
 * named, typed value. Properties have two names: a short descriptive name, not
 * necessarily unique; and a formal name guaranteed unique. The descriptive name
 * is implied by the accessor method that returns it. For example, the method
 * <code>String getReportableName()</code> defines a scalar string-valued property named
 * "Name". the formal name is an identifier in JHOVE2 namespace based on the
 * name of the {@link org.jhove2.core.reportable.Reportable} containing the property
 * concatenated with the property's descriptive name.
