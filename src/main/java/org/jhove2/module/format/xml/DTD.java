 * This class is used to hold information about a <i>document type declaration</i>
 * discovered during parsing of an XML instance.
 * <p>
 * An <i>external identifier</i> (if present) is either a <i>system identifier</i> or a
 * <i>public identifier</i>, either of which must contain a <i>system
 * literal</i> (e.g. a URI reference), that points to a separate storage object
 * (such as a file or a web resource). A <i>public identifier</i> also includes
 * a public resource name that may be used via a xml catalog (or similar) lookup
 * mechanism to resolve the entity reference.
