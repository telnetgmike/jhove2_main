Status:  Final

RELEASE NOTES


VERSION 2.1.0

Version 2.1.0 of JHOVE2 includes 3 new format modules, 1 new Identifier module, and 
several bug fixes and enhancements from the Issues page on the JHOVE2 wiki 
(https://bitbucket.org/jhove2/main/issues).

New format modules included in this release:
	ARC
	GZIP
	WARC
	
	
New identifier module included in this release:

This release includes a new identifier module, based on the Unix "file" utility. The downloadable
release is configured to run the DROID identifier that was released in version 2.0.0.  
For information on how to install the "file" utility on Windows, MAC, and Unix machines, and for
information on how to update the JHOVE2 Spring configuration files to employ the new Identifier
module, please see the "Specification and Installation/Configuration Guide" for the File
Identifier Module on the JHOVE2 wiki modules page 
(https://bytebucket.org/jhove2/main/wiki/documents/JHOVE2-File-module-spec-2.1.0RC2.pdf).

VERSION 2.0.0


JHOVE2 is a next-generation framework and application for format-aware
characterization.  Characterization is the process of deriving representation
information about a formatted digital object that is indicative of its
significant nature and is useful for purposes of classification, analysis, and
use.  Effective and efficient means of characterization is a key component of
any digital preservation program.

JHOVE2 supports four specific aspects of characterization:

- Identification.  The process of determining the presumptive format of a
  digital object on the basis of suggestive extrinsic hints and intrinsic
  signatures, both internal (e.g. magic number) and external (e.g. file
  extension). 

- Validation.  The process of determining the level of conformance to the
  normative syntactic and semantic rules defined by the authoritative
  specification of the object's format. 

- Feature extraction.  The process of reporting the intrinsic properties of
  a digital object significant for purposes of classification, analysis, and
  use. 

- Assessment.  The process of determining the level of acceptability of a
  digital object for a specific purpose on the basis of locally-defined
  policy rules.

The object of JHOVE2 characterization can be a file, a subset of a file, or
an aggregation of an arbitrary number of files that collectively represent a
single coherent digital object.  JHOVE2 can automatically process objects
that are arbitrarily nested in containers, such as file system directories or
Zip files.

The JHOVE2 project seeks to build on the success of the original JHOVE
characterization tool (http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove) by addressing known
limitations and offering significant new functions.  These enhancements
include:

- Streamlined APIs incorporating increased modularization and uniform design
  patterns.

- Object-focused, rather than file-focused, characterization, with support
  for arbitrarily-nested container formats and formats instantiated across
  multiple files.

- Signature-based identification using DROID
  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/droid).

- Rules-based assessment to support determinations of object acceptability
  in addition to validation of format conformity.

- Extensive user configuration of modules, characterization strategies, 
  localized messages, and formatted results.

- Performance improvements using Java buffered I/O (java.nio).

- Persistence manager to support the characterization of an arbitrary
  number of objects with a fixed memory footprint. 

The JHOVE2 project is a collaborative undertaking of the University of
California Curation Center at the California Digital Library, Portico, and
Stanford University, with generous funding from the Library of Congress as
part of its National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation
Program (NDIIPP).

JHOVE2 is made freely available under the terms of the BSD open source
license for all project-developed code; some third-party libraries may be
covered by other open source licenses.

VERSION 2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 of JHOVE2 supports all the major technical objectives of the
project, including a more sophisticated modular architecture; signature-based
file identification; policy-based assessment of objects; recursive
characterization of objects comprising aggregate files and files arbitrarily-
nested in containers; and extensive configuration and reporting options.
It provides a stable interface against which developers can create additional
format modules.

Format modules, and profiles, included in this release are:

- ICC color profile
- SGML
- Shapefile     Main, Index, dBASE
- TIFF          4-6, Class B, G, R, P, Y, TIFF/IT, TIFF/EP, Exif, GeoTIFF, DNG
- UTF-8         ASCII
- WAVE          Broadcast Wave Format
- XML
- Zip

Please note that the Zip module comprises a non-validating partial module,
which accomplishes recursive JHOVE2 descent on the contents of the Zip file,
but does not yet validate the Zip file itself against the standard.

Version 2.0.0 of JHOVE2 can be downloaded from
https://bitbucket.org/jhove2/main/downloads.

Download packages are available in Zip and tar.gz form.
